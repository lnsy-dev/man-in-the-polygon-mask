## The Figure in the Whiteout

The Walker in the Snow appeared sometime in the late 2020s, during the decade of the "permanent winter" when climate chaos made weather prediction impossible and blizzards hit places that had never seen snow.

Like [[Slender Man]] before it, The Walker was a figure glimpsed in the background—but only in snow, only in whiteout conditions, only when you were alone. Tall, indistinct, moving with purpose through conditions that should make movement impossible.

Some said it was a survival mechanism, a hallucination generated by hypothermia. Others said it was something older, something that had always been there but only became visible when the world turned white and empty.

The Walker never hurt anyone directly. It just walked. But people who saw it reported feeling an overwhelming urge to follow, to walk out into the storm, to keep walking until they couldn't walk anymore. Search and rescue teams found bodies miles from where they should have been, frozen in positions that suggested they died mid-stride.

By 2035, The Walker had joined the pantheon of digital-age folklore entities: [[Slender Man]], [[La Llorona]], [[Bloody Mary]], the man with the polygon mask. All of them liminal. All of them viral. All of them maybe-real.

[[Theodore Riot the Vapor Punk Anthropologist]] argued that these entities were the folkways of a displaced people—not displaced geographically, but displaced temporally, psychologically, ontologically. We don't know where we are anymore, so we generate figures that embody that lostness.

The Walker walks because we're all walking, and none of us know where we're going.
