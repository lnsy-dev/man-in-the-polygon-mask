## The Ocean's Advocate

She has pale blue skin, they say. Not the blue of drowning or hypothermia, but something luminescent, bioluminescent even—like those deep-sea creatures that generate their own light in the crushing dark of the Mariana Trench.

The homeless children know her true name, but they won't speak it. Can't speak it, maybe. The demons made it so she only has power if you know her secret name, and even then, only if you call it out at the exact moment of violence. A bullet tearing through skin becomes lead falling harmlessly to concrete. A knife becomes a child's toy.

She lives in the ocean, which makes sense if you think about it—the ocean being the last place on Earth that capital hasn't fully colonized, though they're working on it. The Blue Lady as the spirit of what remains ungovernable, what refuses the logic of extraction.

Some folklorists connect her to Yemaya, the Santeria ocean goddess. Others see echoes of Mary, mother of the drowned god. But the shelter children's Blue Lady is something else—she's what happens when you need a protector so badly that collective dreaming makes one real.

Or real enough.

In [[Miami]], before it went under, they said she walked the beaches at dawn.
