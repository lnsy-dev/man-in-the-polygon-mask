The memoir of a literary hack / oligarch in the heady post-Soviet days in Russia. Too post-modern for its own good, is it a window into Vladislav Surkov and the other Oligarch's thinking or a smoke screen?

Often times when dealing with the [[Post-Surkovian Media Strategy]] viewpoint we must ask: what is true, or, what is the most interesting lie?
