# The Dog

Riding the 950 north to downtown, I see a dog loping through the liminal concrete space that is north of the interchange, full of containers of rubble. Her nipples swollen, she trots gingerly. She is perhaps a pitbull, though my memory clouds. Her nipples are swollen, her belly loose like a dog who just gave birth.

How did a dog get there, how did she survive?

Life finds liminal spaces, most of us shun it, but some will carve out a brutish living out of despiration or something visionary. Who can tell the difference between the two? I do not feel equipped.

I find myself thinking about her, about her puppies, and I think about the homeless men and women who live under the highway interchange, all the other denizens carving out a place in this concrete island, trapped there. I'm simply a tourist, I pass through it, I do not live it.
