## The Drowned City

Miami went under sometime between 2045 and 2055—the exact date is contested because the drowning wasn't a single event but a slow-motion catastrophe. First the king tides, then the permanent flooding of South Beach, then the exodus, then the silence.

Now it's a reef. The art deco buildings of Ocean Drive serve as artificial habitats for parrotfish and barracuda. The [[Blue Lady]] supposedly walks its submerged streets, though how an ocean spirit "walks" underwater is a question of phenomenology that no one has adequately addressed.

Before it drowned, Miami was the site of the 1997 New Times article that documented the secret stories of homeless children—tales of [[Bloody Mary]] and [[La Llorona]] and angels fighting demons in the sky. The folklorists thought they were studying children's coping mechanisms. The children knew they were documenting a war.

Some claim the city was abandoned not because of rising seas but because [[Bloody Mary]] had claimed it completely. That the water was a mercy, a baptism in reverse, a way of washing clean what had become irredeemably haunted.

The wealthy fled to higher ground. The poor drowned or scattered. Standard operating procedure for late capitalism.

Occasionally, drone footage captures something moving through the flooded streets—a pale blue figure, bioluminescent, walking where no one should be able to walk.
