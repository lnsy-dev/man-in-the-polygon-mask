City in eastern [[Germany]], former East Germany, center of the [[Capitalist Realism]] art movement in the 1990s and 2000s.

Leipzig had cheap rent and empty buildings after reunification, which made it attractive to artists. It also had the weight of history—this was where the Monday Demonstrations began in 1989, the peaceful protests that helped bring down the Berlin Wall.

So when [[Neo Rausch]] and other Leipzig artists started painting in a style they called [[Capitalist Realism]], there was a specific irony to it. These were people who had lived through the collapse of one system and were now watching the triumph of another system that was also, in its own way, absurd.

The paintings that came out of Leipzig in this period have a haunted quality. They look like they're depicting the past, but it's a past that never quite existed, or a present that's pretending to be the past, or a future that's given up on being the future.

Post-reunification melancholy as an aesthetic.
