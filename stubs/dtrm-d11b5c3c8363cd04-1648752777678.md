"In Fatigue Society (original German title: Die MÃ¼digkeitsgesellschaft), Han characterizes today's society as a pathological landscape of neuronal disorders such as depression, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, borderline personality and burnout. He claims that they are not "infections" but "infarcts", which are not caused by the negativity of people's immunology, but by an excess of positivity.[4]" -- from Wikipedia, retreived Thu 15 Mar 2018 01:11:49 PM PDT
