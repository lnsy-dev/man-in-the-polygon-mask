**VENICE BEACH, Calif. (AP)** — Federal authorities have extended the quarantine zone around Venice Beach for an additional six months following what officials are calling "an ongoing biological containment situation."

The incident began three weeks ago when an art installation by the Los Angeles-based Meat Mind Collective experienced what the group initially described as "unplanned organic behavior." The installation consisted of approximately 40,000 liters of laboratory-grown muscle tissue housed in a transparent bio-plastic containment system on the Venice Beach boardwalk.

According to eyewitness accounts, the tissue began infiltrating the containment system's seals on the evening of Jan. 15. "It was wriggling itself into the bio-plastic casing," said Maria Gonzalez, 34, who operates a nearby taco stand. "Then it started leaking this oily stuff all over the boardwalk."

The discharge, which laboratory analysis later identified as approximately 50% industrial solvent and 50% necrotic cellular material, pooled on the boardwalk for several days while the Collective debated whether the behavior was intentional.

"We thought it might be part of the piece," said former Collective member James Chen, 28, speaking from an undisclosed location. "By the time we realized it wasn't, it was too late."

Three members of the Collective — identified as Rebecca Stein, 31, Marcus Williams, 29, and Yuki Tanaka, 42 — were reported missing on Jan. 22. Security footage shows them approaching the installation shortly before dawn. They have not been seen since.

The National Guard established a six-block perimeter on Jan. 28. Officials declined to comment on the current status of the biological material, citing "ongoing remediation efforts."

The Meat Mind Collective has disbanded. Its remaining members could not be reached for comment.
