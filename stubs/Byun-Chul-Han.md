South Korean philosopher who writes about software, sovereignty, and the pathologies of contemporary digital society.

In *Fatigue Society* (Die Müdigkeitsgesellschaft), Han characterizes modern society as a pathological landscape of neuronal disorders—depression, ADHD, borderline personality, burnout. These aren't "infections" but "infarcts," caused not by immunological negativity but by an excess of positivity.

Born in [[Seoul]], South Korea, Han moved to Germany where he became one of the most influential contemporary philosophers writing about digital culture, transparency, and what he calls "the terror of positivity."

His work maps the psychological architecture of late capitalism: the self-exploiting subject, the burnout society, the transparency society where privacy becomes impossible and everything must be made visible.
