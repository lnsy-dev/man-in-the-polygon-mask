English translation of [[La Llorona]]. The name used by homeless children in [[Miami]] shelters who didn't speak Spanish but knew the story anyway.

Translation is always a kind of haunting—the ghost of the original meaning moving through the new language, never quite fitting, always a little wrong.

See [[La Llorona]] for the full story.
