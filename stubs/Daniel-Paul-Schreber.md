## Narrative
Daniel Paul Schreber's _Memoirs of My Nervous Illness_ is one of those books that found me at a formative age -- about 18, when I had decided that the Beats were too juvenile, Science Fiction lacked depth, and I needed a literature that was purer. Along with Robert Burton's _Anatomy of Melancholy_ , it was one of the early Labyrinths I found in my life.

Schreber was a successful lawyer and Judge in Germany, his father was a sort of Doctor Spock of his age-- an expert in child rearing. Of his two sons his eldest committed suicide, the other became the hyper achiever Schreber. Everything came to a crashing hault in 1893, when he simply lost it.

He spent the next decade in the asylum, trying to pull his mind back together. The result was a spectacular, rich cosmology that was his _Memoirs of My Nervous Illness_ .

## The Vision

It is easy to slip into mere gawking, sick fascination, which is part of our fetishization of madness, or taste for the bizarre. But once you pass through you understand what it was you were really looking for: that sight. How did he see that? Caravaggio was mad, also. That sight took him.

Caravaggio found the fleshy and the grotesque of his world, that faith belonged in the gutters, that the violence was the thing the purpose of the modern world, and his violence and his recklessness claimed him. Schreber saw the devolution of the persona, the abstraction and simulacrum, that the new horror of the world would be internal.

I suppose Goya, before him, understood this also. That the most terrible horrors are the ones inside of you. Most of us are too polite, too concerned with how they look to let these visions out.

How did they see that? What did they find down there? The question gnaws at me, more than anything else in my life.
