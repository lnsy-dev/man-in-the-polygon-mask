"A labyrinth can be seen as a diagram of the way life is experienced as a series of unfolding events that are difficult to anticipate, in which perspective constantly shifts" - pg 6

"...it was difficult to remember that a labyrinth was originally a dance or else a pattern on the dancing surface that guided the dancers in their performance" - 7
