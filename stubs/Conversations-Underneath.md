**VENICE BEACH, Calif. (AP)** — National Guard personnel stationed at the Venice Beach quarantine perimeter have reported hearing unusual acoustic phenomena emanating from the site, according to internal military documents obtained by The Associated Press.

The sounds, described in incident reports as "rhythmic vocalizations" and "structured acoustic patterns," are audible only through hydrophones or by placing one's ear directly against surfaces where the biological discharge has pooled.

Sgt. Michael Torres, 34, was the first to file a formal report. "It sounded like whales," Torres wrote. "Or maybe modems connecting. I don't know. It sounded like something trying to talk."

Four additional personnel filed similar reports within 48 hours. One soldier, whose name was redacted from the documents, wrote: "It sounded like my mother arguing with my father about whether to let me live. Both of them are dead."

Dr. Theodore Riot, an anthropologist who has studied the recordings, claims they show evidence of "emergent syntax."

"The tissue is inventing language," Riot said in a phone interview. "The rhythm accelerates over time. The call-and-response patterns become more complex. It's learning how to communicate."

Military officials incinerated the discharge on Feb. 3, before Riot could complete his analysis. However, audio recordings of the phenomena have circulated on encrypted forums, where users report experiencing vivid dreams after listening.

"Dreams of being dissolved," wrote one anonymous poster. "Of becoming plural. Of thinking in meat."

Three individuals who downloaded the recordings have been reported missing by family members. Police found their apartments empty except for oily stains on floors and walls. The stains were not collected for analysis.

The recordings have been classified by the Department of Defense. A spokesperson declined to comment on their contents, citing "ongoing national security concerns."

Dr. Riot's research grant was terminated by the National Science Foundation on Feb. 15. The foundation did not provide a reason for the termination.

When asked whether the conversations could still be heard at the Venice Beach site, military officials said the biological material had been "completely neutralized." They declined to explain why the quarantine perimeter remains in place.

Local residents report hearing sounds from the storm drains at night. City officials attribute the sounds to "normal urban infrastructure noise."
