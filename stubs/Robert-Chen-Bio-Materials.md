**Robert Chen, PhD**

President, Bio-Materials Industry Association (2022-Present)

**Education**

PhD, Materials Science and Engineering, MIT (2008)  
MS, Chemical Engineering, Stanford University (2004)  
BS, Chemistry, UC Berkeley (2002)

**Professional Experience**

*Bio-Materials Industry Association, Washington, DC*  
President (2022-Present)
- Represents 340+ bio-materials manufacturers
- Led successful lobbying effort to overturn California bio-plastic ban (February 2026)
- Testified before Congress on bio-materials safety (March 2026)

*NatureWorks LLC, Minnetonka, MN*  
Vice President, Research and Development (2015-2022)

*DuPont Industrial Biosciences, Wilmington, DE*  
Senior Research Scientist (2010-2015)

**Industry Leadership**

Board Member, Society of Plastics Engineers (2018-Present)  
Advisory Committee, National Institute of Standards and Technology (2020-Present)  
Consultant, FDA Center for Devices and Radiological Health (2019-2024)

**Patents**

Holder of 23 patents related to bio-plastic manufacturing and applications

**Publications**

*The Bio-Plastic Revolution: Sustainable Materials for the 21st Century* (Wiley, 2020)  
Over 60 peer-reviewed articles in materials science journals

**Public Statements on Venice Beach Incident**

"Bio-plastics are inert materials. They don't want anything. They can't want anything. The Venice Beach incident was a tragic accident caused by improper containment protocols, not by any inherent property of the materials themselves."

"Reports of 'whispering' bio-plastics are easily explained by thermal expansion. These are physical phenomena, not evidence of consciousness or intent."

**Controversies**

- Criticized by materials scientists for dismissing [[Bio-Plastic Sentience Hypothesis]] without peer review
- Accused of conflicts of interest in testimony to California legislature
- Declined to address reports of overnight research shift cancellations at member facilities

**Industry Impact**

Under Chen's leadership, the Bio-Materials Industry Association successfully prevented federal regulation of bio-plastic manufacturing following the Venice Beach incident. The industry's "philosophically inert" certification program remains voluntary and self-regulated.

**Current Activities**

Continues to advocate for bio-materials industry interests. Declined interview requests for this profile.
