summary: "A curious example in the early stages of the anthropocene was the weaponization of nature itself. In earlier, pre-contemporay times, there was the superstition that the sovreign states owned so called \"Earthquake Guns\", and could \"Seed Clouds\" to make them rain. Of course now we know that to be \"Fake News\", in the parlance of the time. Early stages of this included the weaponization of anthrax-- the most famous was in the \"pre-crisis\" era of 2001-2002, which represented the absolute peak of United States of America's final dominance on world bio-power."

## Narrative

Early news reports started in the Science and Agriculture sections of the news-sites. Outside of Columbus, Ohio in the United States, plants swelling up with mucus of some sort began to be noticed. Even more odd, however, was that the blight spread to all plants. A virus across genus. Vast layers of leaf tissue, up to 1 inch thick, it's cells operating in some kind of overdrive to expand wider and wider. Piles of cells, they would then start turning crystaline with fructose in the sunlight.

After the inevitable die off, in the muck of the fields swollen with manure and rotting vegetable, then rotting carcasus and rotting vegetables, and, then: a frightening silence of no birds or insects.

It seemed to be a return to an earlier form of time: the large monospecies dominance of Neoproterozoic was suggested as the most similar time period of countless acres of once fertile Midwest America, the bacteria, no longer beaten back by antibiotics and astringent, had the run of the world again, for a time. The fields turned into a teeming muck, giving off massive amounts of methane.

After the swelling and the die offs, the next year saw a new type of dandelion -- it's yellow top just off one shade of yellow. It expanded, but completely-- the ground seemed to be the perfect nutritional bath, some of the weeds grew to 3 meters high. It was resistant to herbacides. The fields that escaped the blight were quickly inundated, the survival crops decimated, also.

Some tried to turn it into a cash crop-- Demonlion Wine was one attempt, that was recalled when it's chemical makeup turned out to cause hypothyroidism in its heavy users. While the initial reports were quiet, discussed with hushed tones among academics, once the panic started it spread quickly -- quarantines at the borders of the states across the highways and trains then became quarantines in the cities and then the riots. Several archive from the "YouTube" illustrate the midwest famons the best. It was the "first personal civil war, a constantly twisting psychomachia of atrocity and counter atrocity", to quote Theodore-Riot the Vapor Punk Anthropologist, the street fights and car bombs spreading not in any "North or South" direction but seemingly in all directions and all at once. Military Academics describe the fighting as "the first case we know of of urban guerilla warfare using mostly drones". Machine learning running on server farms a thousand miles away to hunt and destroy fellow drones batttled in terrifying swarms above the cities, their corpses crashing into buildings, laying waste to the cities they, at alternating times, wished to protect or level.

Even the coastal cities saw unrest in the constantly shifting battle lines and theological wars. Radical Natureists used this as the opportunity to bomb refineries, declaring that the coasts would bring us into "a natures paradise" but only after the masses agreed to cull themselves 10 fold.

In this instance, capitalism actually had a solution to this unrest. A heavy investment into modern greenhouses to grow crops separated from the now toxic world made Icelandic business man Snorri Johansen and "Post-Ecological Terraforming Prophet" into a trillionaire. He quickly expanded into glass manufacturing-- massive solar powered high-focus sand cinterers across Tunesia and Algeria from its pristine, untouched state into a heavy industrial machine, turning sun and sand into quantum-diodes and diamond slabs for construction. Some remain concered about the long term ecological effects -- "In the next century it is possible that the entire Sahara Desert might be lowered up to 10 feet below sea level due to sand mining and manufacturing" reads one particularily shrill report. Will Neo-Carthage once again get claimed by nature and empire, its lands not even salted but negated by the final fits of industrial capitalism? History throws it's empty bottles out the window, says Chris Marker.

It was not until 4 years later did a full accounting of the cause of the decimation of the midwest be traced back to a single genetic engineer, working at lab at UCLA. The suspected perpetuater, like in the pre-crisis anthrax scare, committed suicide before he could be questioned.

### footnote (narrative):
"I didn't realize that that summer before would be the last time any one of us heard the 17 year cicadas", recalls Doctor Marta Wexler, "as a girl we used to close the windows, turn on white noise machines to silence the screaming. It drove our dogs nuts. It was the loudest 17 year hatch he had ever heard, I remember one of my great uncles saying. The summer of silence stopped all that. The only sound I remember from that era is my mother crying, almost screaming, and the too light thud of her frail frame falling to the ground, the silence around us not even offering an echo in response. In the moment, I remember how I wanted, so badly to hear the cicadas again. To me it represent's natures last stand against us. A final howl of animal fecundity before the rational world with all of its genocides, mechanization and austerity claimed the Earth itself. I think I was seven."
