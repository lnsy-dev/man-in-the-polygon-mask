## The Mother Who Kills

The secret story that shelter children will only tell in hushed voices: [[Bloody Mary]] was Jesus Christ's mother.

Think about that for a second. Let it sit wrong in your brain.

She killed her own child—or watched him die, which in the logic of shelter folklore amounts to the same thing—and made a secret vow to kill all human children. Satan fears her because she understands grief in a way that pure evil cannot. She weaponized it.

You conjure her by chanting her name before a mirror in a pitch-dark room. In [[Miami]] shelters, the mirror must be coated with ocean water, a theft from the [[Blue Lady]]'s domain. When she crashes through the glass, she mutilates children before killing them. She carries a red rosary that she uses as a weapon, striking children across the face.

But here's the thing about [[Bloody Mary]]: she can insinuate herself into the heart of whomever children trust most. A parent. A best friend. The call is coming from inside the house, as they used to say.

Polygenesis—the simultaneous appearance of the same myth in far-flung locales—suggests either collective unconscious or something actually moving through the world. Folklorists prefer the former explanation. Shelter children know better.

She's in [[Miami]]. And she knows your face.
