Some people claim the man in the polygon mask isn't real-- the last echos of folkways as they get swallowed up by technology. Like, decades earlier, [[Slender Man]],[[ La Llorona]] and her eternal enemy, [[The Blue Lady]], from now underwater and abandoned [[Miami]], and even earlier [[The Walker In The Snow]]. How ridiculous, they say, that someone could don a mask and then just stroll through sovreignties like an oligarch, not recognized by the surveillance cameras, not spotted by the drones.

All one had to do was get their mask right -- the right cryptographic hash of polygons, writ large, and you would leave silence in your wake.

Just the concept violated some truth of the world, a way of being no one could grasp -- something best left to the old world's memories of magic.
