**LOS ANGELES (AP)** — Laboratory analysis of the substance found at the Venice Beach quarantine site has raised more questions than answers, according to documents obtained by The Associated Press.

The discharge, described by witnesses as having an "oily sheen, like gasoline on water," was found to contain approximately 50% industrial solvent and 50% necrotic cellular material. But researchers say the composition doesn't explain the substance's unusual properties.

"It doesn't evaporate. It doesn't dry out. It just sits there," said Dr. Patricia Reeves, a biochemist at UCLA who analyzed samples from the site. "We've had samples sitting in sealed containers for three weeks. No change."

More disturbing, according to Reeves, are the acoustic properties. When researchers placed hydrophones near the discharge, they detected rhythmic patterns that Reeves described as "call-and-response, almost like a conversation."

"It's not random noise," Reeves said. "There's structure to it. Repetition. Variation. It sounds like communication."

Similar discharge has been reported at laboratory sites in Boston, Singapore, and Berlin, according to sources who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the incidents publicly. In each case, the substance appeared in facilities conducting research on laboratory-grown tissue.

Dr. Yuki Tanaka, whose controversial paper on bio-plastic sentience was published last month, claims the discharge is not waste but "reconnaissance."

"The tissue is sending out scouts," Tanaka said. "Little puddles of itself to test the environment, to learn, to report back through chemical gradients."

Federal officials declined to comment on Tanaka's hypothesis. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued a statement saying the discharge "poses no immediate threat to public health" but recommended that anyone encountering similar substances should "avoid direct contact and report the location to local authorities immediately."

Three members of the Meat Mind Collective who were exposed to the discharge remain missing. Security footage from the Venice Beach site shows them kneeling beside the pooled substance, appearing to listen to it, in the hours before they disappeared.

The footage has been classified. Transcripts of the audio, which reportedly captured the missing individuals speaking to the discharge, have not been released.
