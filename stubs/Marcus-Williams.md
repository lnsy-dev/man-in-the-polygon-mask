**Last Known Communication**

Email to [[James Chen]] sent at 11:43 PM, January 21, 2026:

"The tissue is doing something with the plastic. Not breaking it. Talking to it. I know how that sounds. I'm going back to the site in the morning. If I'm right about this, everything we thought we knew about material consciousness is wrong. If I'm wrong, I'll buy you breakfast and we'll laugh about it."

Williams did not respond to subsequent messages. Security footage shows him arriving at the Venice Beach site at 4:51 AM on January 22, 2026, approximately four minutes after [[Rebecca Stein]].

**Investigation Status**

Missing person case remains open. Williams' research notes have been classified by federal authorities. His family has filed a lawsuit demanding access to the security footage.
