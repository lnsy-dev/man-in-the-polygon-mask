## The Weeping Woman

La Llorona—The Crying Woman—is old folklore, Mexican and Central American, the ghost of a woman who drowned her children and now wanders waterways weeping, searching for them, sometimes drowning other children in her grief-madness.

But in the 1980s, something changed. Children of Mexican migrant workers in the United States started using "La Llorona" as another name for [[Bloody Mary]]. The two figures merged, or maybe they were always the same figure, just wearing different cultural masks.

By the 1990s, homeless children in [[Miami]] shelters knew her by both names. [[Bloody Mary]] and [[La Llorona]]. The demon feared even by Satan. The mother who kills.

What's interesting—what the folklorists couldn't explain—is how the myth spread. This was before social media, before smartphones. How did children in Miami shelters tell the same stories as children in Chicago, Oakland, New Orleans? How did they use the same language, the same imagery?

Polygenesis, the folklorists said. Simultaneous invention.

Or maybe La Llorona is real, and she's been walking the length of the Americas for centuries, and children can see her because children haven't yet learned to look away.

She weeps blood or black tears from ghoulish empty sockets. Her clothes blow back even in rooms where there is no wind. And if she sees your face, she can hunt you forever.
