**Venice Beach Investigation**

Lead biochemical analyst for UCLA team examining [[The Oily Discharge]]. First to document the substance's non-evaporative properties and acoustic phenomena. Testimony to federal investigators remains classified.

**Public Statements**

"The composition is straightforward: fifty percent solvent, fifty percent necrotic cells. But the behavior is unprecedented. In thirty years of studying biological materials, I've never seen anything that refuses to follow basic thermodynamic principles. It doesn't dry. It doesn't degrade. It just... persists."

**Current Research**

Dr. Reeves' laboratory continues to maintain samples of the Venice Beach discharge under CDC oversight. Her research grant was renewed in March 2026 with additional classified funding. She has published no peer-reviewed work on the material, citing "ongoing security review."

**Security Clearance**

Secret (granted February 2026)

**Note**

Dr. Reeves has declined all media interviews since March 2026. Colleagues report she no longer works in the laboratory after dark.
