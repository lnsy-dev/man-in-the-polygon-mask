Born post-crisis, post-info-economy, Theodore Riot the Vapor Punk Anthropologist  became known for studying the the concept of copyright of the early 21st century, and how its particular beaurocratic shape led to the final subsumation of  folk ways by information culture. Building on the concept of a [[Charismatic Mega Algorithm]] first highlighted by [[Nick Seaver]] in 2018, Theodore Riot the Vapor Punk Anthropologist sought to construct "a cultural framework for the new post-territorial pile". Dismissed in his early career as a crank for using performance art, augmented reality and found powerpoint slides in his lectures, he later achieved the prominince in the United States that Baudrillard or Byung-Chul Han in their respective countries achieved.

"We used to talk about cyborgs, that there was a separation between man and technology, that we weren't first technological beings, the first with that Ur technique of language. That notion doesn't even glitch, the process just stops running as we realized that bio-power by its nature had to give way to newer, multivalent systems of control"

"The empire never ended", he liked to quote, from an author whose name has fled from our new cybernetic memories.
