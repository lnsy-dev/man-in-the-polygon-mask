"We founded the Society and prepared a revolt of the simple, two-dimensionals against the complex and sly, against those who do not answer yes or no who do not say white or black, who know some third word, many, many third words, empty, deceptive, confusing the way, obscuring the truth. In these shadows and spider webs, in these false complexities, hide and multiply all the villainies of the world. They are the House of Satan. That's where they make bombs and money, saying: Here's money for the good of the honest; here are bombs for the defense of love.

We will come tomorrow. We will conquer or perish. There is no third way."

-Without Sky by Natan Dubovitsky (possibly the pen name of Vladislav Surkov)


Post-Modern Russia exports Oil, Grain and Information Warfare. It lacks an army that is capable of projecting itself across any geographic distance, trapping it in its immediate borders for any real military action. Even it's annexation -- Ukraine being the most immediate example -- require subterfuge. While nuclear weapons, a fundamental component of their security strategy, remains out of reach because of the massive economic, social and environmental costs.

Where they can project, however, is through the telecommunications networks of the world. The same with rogue states such as North Korea-- but what we saw in 2016 and since is an exportation of Russian media strategy, heavily influenced if not directed by Vladimir Putin's so called "Grey Cardinal" Vladislav Surkov. Using the technique of "dramaturgiya" -- a sort of political reality TV where Surkov would fund opposition groups only to expose that funding later, to generate drama that distracted away from real scandal -- Surkov has been instrument in generating the fake consensus that is essential for the Russian "Managed Democracy" to maintain its current form.

In 2016, with Donald Trump and oposition to Donald Trump -- Bernie Sanders, Jill Stein -- was a classic Surkovian play.

If real representational democracy is going to survive in a world of noise, we need new tools to respond and adapt to a world of half fiction.

## The Negotiation

Many suspect Surkov of writing under the pen name Natan Dubovistky, a middling post-modern science fiction writer. There are precious few translations of his work available in English-- as a man with economic sanctions against him, there is no incentive for organizations to translate his work. the translations that do exist exist as bootlegs and dubious copyright lineage.

But if we do look at Surkov from the Dubovitsky angle we can get a sense of his general strategy. Take the story "Without Sky", first published in Russian Pioneer magazine in early 2014, before the "little green men" annexation of Ukraine:

""The goals of those in conflict were quite varied. Each had his own, so to speak: the seizing of disputed pieces of territory; the forced establishment of a new religion; higher ratings or rates; the testing of new military rays and airships; the final ban on separating people into male and female, since sexual differentiation undermines the unity of the nation; and so forth.

The simple-hearted commanders of the past strove for victory. Now they did not act so stupidly. That is, some, of course, still clung to the old habits and tried to exhume from the archives old slogans of the type: victory will be ours. It worked in some places, but basically, war was now understood as a process, more exactly, part of a process, its acute phase, but maybe not the most important.

Some peoples joined the war specifically to be defeated. They were inspired by the flowering of Germany and France after being routed in the second World War. It turned out that to achieve such a defeat was no simpler than achieving victory. Determination, sacrifice, and the extraordinary exertion of all forces were required, and, in addition, flexibility, cold-bloodedness, and the ability to profitably administer one's own cowardice and dullness."
