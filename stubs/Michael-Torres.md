**Venice Beach Incident Report**

First filed report of [[Conversations Underneath]] on January 30, 2026. Incident report excerpt:

"At approximately 0230 hours, while conducting perimeter patrol, I detected unusual acoustic phenomena emanating from the containment site. Upon investigation with issued hydrophone equipment, I observed structured rhythmic patterns inconsistent with environmental noise. The sounds resembled biological vocalizations, possibly cetacean in nature, or electronic communication signals. Request technical analysis and guidance."

**Subsequent Reports**

Filed three additional incident reports documenting escalating acoustic complexity (February 1, 3, and 5, 2026). Reports were classified following federal takeover of the operation.

Underwent mandatory psychological evaluation following incident reports. Evaluation concluded: "Sgt. Torres demonstrates no signs of psychological distress or impairment. His reports are consistent, detailed, and credible. Recommend continued monitoring."
