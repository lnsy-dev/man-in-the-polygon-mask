summary: "An internet shitstorm can have many types of actors -- bots, psyops, sincere activists and pranksters to name a few."
title: "Swarm Velocity and Vectors"

---
Byun Hal insists modern internet social dynamics move as a swarm not as a crowd. A crowd has a purpose, a center. A swarm has a velocity and a vector, but it's movements are amorphous.

A swarm can contain sincere actors-- activists, politicians, news broadcasters trying to tell a story -- around a meme. But when it s exposed to the eco system other actors for their own purposes jump on board: Russian bots attempting to sew division among American public, Spammers trying to get users to click through to malware links, hackivist troll armies or pr firms attempting to increase the visibility of their clients / patrons, Russian bots trained to accuse others of being Russian bots.

In modern democracies we should not be limiting speech, and as an argument, the "Russian Bot" ad hominem offers nothing to the conversation. But by being able to observe the bot networks, by understanding their impulses and direction we can generate a thurough understanding of their goals. We can start to predict whihc events and scandals they will try to popularize, we can start to move before they do, to counter an attack at the right moment-- mass reporting of bot behavior, our own counter bot narrative.
