German painter, born 1960 in [[Leipzig]], key figure in the [[Capitalist Realism]] movement—though "movement" might be too strong a word for what was essentially a wry joke that became an art historical category.

Rauch's paintings are strange, dreamlike, populated by figures in ambiguous relationships doing ambiguous things in spaces that feel like they're from the 1950s but also from nowhere. Socialist Realism filtered through post-reunification confusion and irony.

The name "Capitalist Realism" was a response to Socialist Realism, the official art style of the Soviet Union. If Socialist Realism depicted the glorious future of the workers' paradise, Capitalist Realism depicted... what? The banal present of consumer society? The emptiness behind the advertising?

Rauch's work has that quality of [[Simulator Sickness]]—you're looking at something that seems real but feels wrong, like a video game rendering of reality that's just slightly off.
