The first video I remember seeing by ******* was her on the motorcylce. A real, diesel burning, environmental catastrophe with all it's shaking and trembling bubbling through her body. She was driving about 100 miles an hour-- a slow speed except when it is just you and a bike-- across an abandoned highway by Teton Pit Mines. A no mans land, owned by her parents allegedly, since given over to what ever the new ecology lays waste to.

The motorcycle rumbled in her belly in a not-wholesome way. You could feel her adrenaline pumping, the bike just at the edge of flying apart, the closeness of death.

People would spend hours repeating the 10 second senso-vid. I admit, it was my favorite for a long time, also.

We wanted the full experience-- petitions online begged her to release the entire ride, there was even a Saturday Night Live skit about it, but then, we know Saturday Night Live isn't very good these days. But ******* wouldn't budge-- the true moment she wanted was free of context. It was vital for that. The absence of sensation before, the lack of preparation, a moment of relaxation of the neurostims doing their clever magic followed by the kick of velocity was in itself the statement.

After her fame grew, the bots, at one point merely spammers, but then the rival brands and nation states took over. That's when her organization brought me on as a consultant.

I wrangle bots, schlepp data, generally turn the manure of digital noise into the fertile soil of asymetrical information advantages. That is to say: I'm an info-mercenary. They used to call it Public Relations, then, in the post-Surkovian age, Information Warfare. I have to admit, it payed me well-- I didn't need much money anyway. My life was pretty simple, living in one of the anonymous diamond towers of Los Angeles. I had the best VR rig in the building. And four locks -- one of them purely mechanical-- to make sure it stayed that way.

I prefered to keep my work for the anonymous corporations that were my normal bread and butter-- let the spokesperson take the credit, and me taking the money. But, even though I don't NEED lots of money, they were offering me stupid amounts of it. "A new type of team, *****," my friend J____, who had gave them their number had said. "You'll get to design the architecture, choose the neural net cowboys. You're going to get to build the most massive hype and counter-hype machine anyone has ever built"

I'm just a mercenary, and you can only write the same hostile-Actuary algorithms so many times before it all runs together. I needed something new. And, a bunch of money might do the trick.
