European nation, birthplace of [[Capitalist Realism]] (the art movement, not the Mark Fisher book, though both are relevant).

Also birthplace of [[Daniel Paul Schreber]], whose _Memoirs of My Nervous Illness_ remains one of the most spectacular accounts of psychosis ever written. Schreber saw the devolution of the persona, the abstraction and simulacrum, the new horror of the world being internal—and he saw it in 1903, before Freud, before the World Wars, before the internet.

Germany has a particular relationship with madness and system-building. Maybe it's the language, which allows you to construct compound words of arbitrary length, thoughts that spiral into themselves. Maybe it's the history, which keeps looping back on itself in ways that feel like [[Labyrinths]].

[[Leipzig]], in the former East, became the center of [[Capitalist Realism]] after reunification. Artists painting the emptiness of the new system in the ruins of the old system.
