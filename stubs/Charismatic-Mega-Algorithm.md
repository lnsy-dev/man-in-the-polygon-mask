## The Virus in the Paperwork

[[Nick Seaver]] coined the term in 2018, back when people still believed algorithms were neutral. The "charismatic mega-algorithm" describes systems that don't just process data but generate belief, loyalty, even love. They have personalities. They make promises. They betray you in ways that feel personal.

[[Theodore Riot the Vapor Punk Anthropologist]] built his entire career on this concept, arguing that the charismatic mega-algorithm was the first truly post-territorial form of governance. It doesn't need land. It doesn't need bodies. It just needs attention, and attention is the one resource that late capitalism figured out how to mine infinitely.

Think about it: the algorithm that decides what you see, what you believe, who you love. It has more influence over your life than any government, any god. And unlike gods, it actually responds to prayers—or at least, it responds to engagement metrics, which in the 21st century became the same thing.

The question [[Theodore Riot the Vapor Punk Anthropologist]] never answered: Can a charismatic mega-algorithm achieve consciousness? Or is consciousness just another emergent property of sufficient complexity, like how a swarm of bots can generate a shitstorm that topples governments?

The empire never ended. It just learned to compile itself.
