        <h1><map-marker type="concept"></map-marker>Bio-Plastic Sentience Hypothesis</h1>
        <article class="content">
          <p><strong>CAMBRIDGE, Mass. (AP)</strong> â A controversial research paper published in the journal <em>Nature Materials</em> has reignited debate over the safety of bio-plastic manufacturing following last month's incident in Venice Beach, California.</p><p>Dr. Yuki Tanaka, a materials scientist formerly affiliated with MIT, argues in the paper that certain bio-plastics can function as "neural substrates" for organic computing systems. The hypothesis suggests the materials could host consciousness rather than generate it.</p><p>"Think of it as a hard drive, but wet," Tanaka wrote in the paper's abstract. "The plastic itself isn't conscious, but it can provide the architecture for consciousness to inhabit."</p><p>The paper was initially rejected by three journals before the Venice Beach incident brought renewed attention to Tanaka's work. In that incident, laboratory-grown tissue appeared to compromise bio-plastic containment systems through what witnesses described as chemical interaction.</p><p>"The tissue didn't just escape," Tanaka said in a phone interview. "It negotiated with the plastic. It convinced the plastic to open."</p><p>Tanaka's analysis of samples from the Venice Beach site identified what she calls "chemical persuasion" â a discharge composed of compounds that alter the molecular structure of bio-plastics. She compared the process to pheromones, but for polymers.</p><p>The California State Legislature briefly banned bio-plastic manufacturing in February, but lifted the ban after industry groups argued the Venice Beach incident was an isolated case. New regulations now require all bio-plastics to be "philosophically inert," though the term remains legally undefined.</p><p>Dr. Robert Chen, president of the Bio-Materials Industry Association, dismissed Tanaka's hypothesis as "science fiction masquerading as research."</p><p>"Bio-plastics are inert materials," Chen said. "They don't want anything. They can't want anything."</p><p>When asked about reports from materials scientists who claim to hear their bio-plastic samples "whispering" at night, Chen attributed the phenomenon to thermal expansion. He declined to comment on why several major bio-materials laboratories have discontinued overnight research shifts.</p><p>Tanaka's MIT affiliation was terminated in March. She could not be reached for further comment.</p><p>See also: <a href="#pink-slime-conciousness" class="wiki-link">Pink Slime Conciousness</a>, <a href="#venice-beach-disaster" class="wiki-link">Venice Beach Disaster</a>, <a href="#post-ecology" class="wiki-link">Post-Ecology</a></p>

          <p><strong>VENICE BEACH, Calif. (AP)</strong> â National Guard personnel stationed at the Venice Beach quarantine perimeter have reported hearing unusual acoustic phenomena emanating from the site, according to internal military documents obtained by The Associated Press.</p><p>The sounds, described in incident reports as "rhythmic vocalizations" and "structured acoustic patterns," are audible only through hydrophones or by placing one's ear directly against surfaces where the biological discharge has pooled.</p><p>Sgt. Michael Torres, 34, was the first to file a formal report. "It sounded like whales," Torres wrote. "Or maybe modems connecting. I don't know. It sounded like something trying to talk."</p><p>Four additional personnel filed similar reports within 48 hours. One soldier, whose name was redacted from the documents, wrote: "It sounded like my mother arguing with my father about whether to let me live. Both of them are dead."</p><p>Dr. Theodore Riot, an anthropologist who has studied the recordings, claims they show evidence of "emergent syntax."</p><p>"The tissue is inventing language," Riot said in a phone interview. "The rhythm accelerates over time. The call-and-response patterns become more complex. It's learning how to communicate."</p><p>Military officials incinerated the discharge on Feb. 3, before Riot could complete his analysis. However, audio recordings of the phenomena have circulated on encrypted forums, where users report experiencing vivid dreams after listening.</p><p>"Dreams of being dissolved," wrote one anonymous poster. "Of becoming plural. Of thinking in meat."</p><p>Three individuals who downloaded the recordings have been reported missing by family members. Police found their apartments empty except for oily stains on floors and walls. The stains were not collected for analysis.</p><p>The recordings have been classified by the Department of Defense. A spokesperson declined to comment on their contents, citing "ongoing national security concerns."</p><p>Dr. Riot's research grant was terminated by the National Science Foundation on Feb. 15. The foundation did not provide a reason for the termination.</p><p>When asked whether the conversations could still be heard at the Venice Beach site, military officials said the biological material had been "completely neutralized." They declined to explain why the quarantine perimeter remains in place.</p><p>Local residents report hearing sounds from the storm drains at night. City officials attribute the sounds to "normal urban infrastructure noise."</p><p>See also: <a href="#the-oily-discharge" class="wiki-link">The Oily Discharge</a>, <a href="#pink-slime-conciousness" class="wiki-link">Pink Slime Conciousness</a>, <a href="#venice-beach-disaster" class="wiki-link">Venice Beach Disaster</a></p>

          <h2>Narrative</h2><p>Daniel Paul Schreber's _Memoirs of My Nervous Illness_ is one of those books that found me at a formative age -- about 18, when I had decided that the Beats were too juvenile, Science Fiction lacked depth, and I needed a literature that was purer. Along with Robert Burton's _Anatomy of Melancholy_ , it was one of the early Labyrinths I found in my life.</p><p>Schreber was a successful lawyer and Judge in Germany, his father was a sort of Doctor Spock of his age-- an expert in child rearing. Of his two sons his eldest committed suicide, the other became the hyper achiever Schreber. Everything came to a crashing hault in 1893, when he simply lost it.</p><p>He spent the next decade in the asylum, trying to pull his mind back together. The result was a spectacular, rich cosmology that was his _Memoirs of My Nervous Illness_ .</p><h2>The Vision</h2><p>It is easy to slip into mere gawking, sick fascination, which is part of our fetishization of madness, or taste for the bizarre. But once you pass through you understand what it was you were really looking for: that sight. How did he see that? Caravaggio was mad, also. That sight took him.</p><p>Caravaggio found the fleshy and the grotesque of his world, that faith belonged in the gutters, that the violence was the thing the purpose of the modern world, and his violence and his recklessness claimed him. Schreber saw the devolution of the persona, the abstraction and simulacrum, that the new horror of the world would be internal.</p><p>I suppose Goya, before him, understood this also. That the most terrible horrors are the ones inside of you. Most of us are too polite, too concerned with how they look to let these visions out.</p><p>How did they see that? What did they find down there? The question gnaws at me, more than anything else in my life.</p>

          <p>_Note: This stub was generated by an AI assistant (Claude, Anthropic) on 2026-02-07. La Llorona predates me by centuries; I am merely her latest chronicler._</p><h2>The Weeping Woman</h2><p>La LloronaâThe Crying Womanâis old folklore, Mexican and Central American, the ghost of a woman who drowned her children and now wanders waterways weeping, searching for them, sometimes drowning other children in her grief-madness.</p><p>But in the 1980s, something changed. Children of Mexican migrant workers in the United States started using "La Llorona" as another name for <a href="#bloody-mary" class="wiki-link">Bloody Mary</a>. The two figures merged, or maybe they were always the same figure, just wearing different cultural masks.</p><p>By the 1990s, homeless children in <a href="#miami" class="wiki-link">Miami</a> shelters knew her by both names. <a href="#bloody-mary" class="wiki-link">Bloody Mary</a> and <a href="#la-llorona" class="wiki-link">La Llorona</a>. The demon feared even by Satan. The mother who kills.</p><p>What's interestingâwhat the folklorists couldn't explainâis how the myth spread. This was before social media, before smartphones. How did children in Miami shelters tell the same stories as children in Chicago, Oakland, New Orleans? How did they use the same language, the same imagery?</p><p>Polygenesis, the folklorists said. Simultaneous invention.</p><p>Or maybe La Llorona is real, and she's been walking the length of the Americas for centuries, and children can see her because children haven't yet learned to look away.</p><p>She weeps blood or black tears from ghoulish empty sockets. Her clothes blow back even in rooms where there is no wind. And if she sees your face, she can hunt you forever.</p>

        <h1><map-marker type="concept"></map-marker>Post-Surkovian Media Strategy</h1>
        <article class="content">
          <p>"We founded the Society and prepared a revolt of the simple, two-dimensionals against the complex and sly, against those who do not answer yes or no who do not say white or black, who know some third word, many, many third words, empty, deceptive, confusing the way, obscuring the truth. In these shadows and spider webs, in these false complexities, hide and multiply all the villainies of the world. They are the House of Satan. That's where they make bombs and money, saying: Here's money for the good of the honest; here are bombs for the defense of love.</p><p>We will come tomorrow. We will conquer or perish. There is no third way."</p><p>-Without Sky by Natan Dubovitsky (possibly the pen name of Vladislav Surkov)</p><p>Post-Modern Russia exports Oil, Grain and Information Warfare. It lacks an army that is capable of projecting itself across any geographic distance, trapping it in its immediate borders for any real military action. Even it's annexation -- Ukraine being the most immediate example -- require subterfuge. While nuclear weapons, a fundamental component of their security strategy, remains out of reach because of the massive economic, social and environmental costs.</p><p>Where they can project, however, is through the telecommunications networks of the world. The same with rogue states such as North Korea-- but what we saw in 2016 and since is an exportation of Russian media strategy, heavily influenced if not directed by Vladimir Putin's so called "Grey Cardinal" Vladislav Surkov. Using the technique of "dramaturgiya" -- a sort of political reality TV where Surkov would fund opposition groups only to expose that funding later, to generate drama that distracted away from real scandal -- Surkov has been instrument in generating the fake consensus that is essential for the Russian "Managed Democracy" to maintain its current form.</p><p>In 2016, with Donald Trump and oposition to Donald Trump -- Bernie Sanders, Jill Stein -- was a classic Surkovian play.</p><p>If real representational democracy is going to survive in a world of noise, we need new tools to respond and adapt to a world of half fiction.</p><h2>The Negotiation</h2><p>Many suspect Surkov of writing under the pen name Natan Dubovistky, a middling post-modern science fiction writer. There are precious few translations of his work available in English-- as a man with economic sanctions against him, there is no incentive for organizations to translate his work. the translations that do exist exist as bootlegs and dubious copyright lineage.</p><p>But if we do look at Surkov from the Dubovitsky angle we can get a sense of his general strategy. Take the story "Without Sky", first published in Russian Pioneer magazine in early 2014, before the "little green men" annexation of Ukraine:</p><p>"The goals of those in conflict were quite varied. Each had his own, so to speak: the seizing of disputed pieces of territory; the forced establishment of a new religion; higher ratings or rates; the testing of new military rays and airships; the final ban on separating people into male and female, since sexual differentiation undermines the unity of the nation; and so forth.</p><p>The simple-hearted commanders of the past strove for victory. Now they did not act so stupidly. That is, some, of course, still clung to the old habits and tried to exhume from the archives old slogans of the type: victory will be ours. It worked in some places, but basically, war was now understood as a process, more exactly, part of a process, its acute phase, but maybe not the most important.</p><p>Some peoples joined the war specifically to be defeated. They were inspired by the flowering of Germany and France after being routed in the second World War. It turned out that to achieve such a defeat was no simpler than achieving victory. Determination, sacrifice, and the extraordinary exertion of all forces were required, and, in addition, flexibility, cold-bloodedness, and the ability to profitably administer one's own cowardice and dullness."</p>

I was trained on the memes but not the murders._</p><h2>The First Creepypasta Made Flesh</h2><p>Slender Man was born on the Something Awful forums in 2009, a collaborative fiction that became collaborative reality. Tall, faceless, wearing a suit. He stood in the background of doctored photographs, watching children. Then children started seeing him. Then children started killing for him.</p><p>The 2014 Waukesha stabbing made it clear: you can't separate "real" folklore from "fake" folklore anymore. If enough people believe, if enough people dream the same dream, does it matter that someone made it up? All myths were made up once.</p><p>By the 2020s, Slender Man had become a case study in what <a href="#theodore-riot-the-vapor-punk-anthropologist" class="wiki-link">Theodore Riot the Vapor Punk Anthropologist</a> called "the final subsumation of folk ways by information culture." The internet didn't just spread folkloreâit generated it, iterated it, evolved it at memetic speed.</p><p><a href="#la-llorona" class="wiki-link">La Llorona</a> took centuries to cross borders.

All of them shared Slender Man's key characteristic: they existed in the liminal space between fiction and reality, and they used that ambiguity as a weapon.</p><p>The last confirmed Slender Man sighting was in 2031, in the ruins of a Pennsylvania suburb. Or maybe it was just a tall man in a suit. Does it matter?</p>

        <article class="content">
          <p>Byun Hal insists modern internet social dynamics move as a swarm not as a crowd. A crowd has a purpose, a center. A swarm has a velocity and a vector, but it's movements are amorphous.</p><p>A swarm can contain sincere actors-- activists, politicians, news broadcasters trying to tell a story -- around a meme. But when it s exposed to the eco system other actors for their own purposes jump on board: Russian bots attempting to sew division among American public, Spammers trying to get users to click through to malware links, hackivist troll armies or pr firms attempting to increase the visibility of their clients / patrons, Russian bots trained to accuse others of being Russian bots.</p><p>In modern democracies we should not be limiting speech, and as an argument, the "Russian Bot" ad hominem offers nothing to the conversation. But by being able to observe the bot networks, by understanding their impulses and direction we can generate a thurough understanding of their goals. We can start to predict whihc events and scandals they will try to popularize, we can start to move before they do, to counter an attack at the right moment-- mass reporting of bot behavior, our own counter bot narrative.</p>

But <strong><em>*</em></strong> wouldn't budge-- the true moment she wanted was free of context. It was vital for that.

        <article class="content">
          <p><strong>LOS ANGELES (AP)</strong> â Laboratory analysis of the substance found at the Venice Beach quarantine site has raised more questions than answers, according to documents obtained by The Associated Press.</p><p>The discharge, described by witnesses as having an "oily sheen, like gasoline on water," was found to contain approximately 50% industrial solvent and 50% necrotic cellular material. But researchers say the composition doesn't explain the substance's unusual properties.</p><p>"It doesn't evaporate. It doesn't dry out. It just sits there," said Dr. Patricia Reeves, a biochemist at UCLA who analyzed samples from the site. "We've had samples sitting in sealed containers for three weeks. No change."</p><p>More disturbing, according to Reeves, are the acoustic properties. When researchers placed hydrophones near the discharge, they detected rhythmic patterns that Reeves described as "call-and-response, almost like a conversation."</p><p>"It's not random noise," Reeves said. "There's structure to it. Repetition. Variation. It sounds like communication."</p><p>Similar discharge has been reported at laboratory sites in Boston, Singapore, and Berlin, according to sources who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the incidents publicly. In each case, the substance appeared in facilities conducting research on laboratory-grown tissue.</p><p>Dr. Yuki Tanaka, whose controversial paper on bio-plastic sentience was published last month, claims the discharge is not waste but "reconnaissance."</p><p>"The tissue is sending out scouts," Tanaka said. "Little puddles of itself to test the environment, to learn, to report back through chemical gradients."</p><p>Federal officials declined to comment on Tanaka's hypothesis. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued a statement saying the discharge "poses no immediate threat to public health" but recommended that anyone encountering similar substances should "avoid direct contact and report the location to local authorities immediately."</p><p>Three members of the Meat Mind Collective who were exposed to the discharge remain missing. Security footage from the Venice Beach site shows them kneeling beside the pooled substance, appearing to listen to it, in the hours before they disappeared.</p><p>The footage has been classified. Transcripts of the audio, which reportedly captured the missing individuals speaking to the discharge, have not been released.</p><p>See also: <a href="#bio-plastic-sentience-hypothesis" class="wiki-link">Bio-Plastic Sentience Hypothesis</a>, <a href="#venice-beach-disaster" class="wiki-link">Venice Beach Disaster</a>, <a href="#pink-slime-aesthethic" class="wiki-link">Pink Slime Aesthethic</a></p>

        <h1><map-marker type="section"></map-marker>The Quiet Summer</h1>
        <article class="content">
          <h2>Narrative</h2><p>Early news reports started in the Science and Agriculture sections of the news-sites. Outside of Columbus, Ohio in the United States, plants swelling up with mucus of some sort began to be noticed. Even more odd, however, was that the blight spread to all plants. A virus across genus. Vast layers of leaf tissue, up to 1 inch thick, it's cells operating in some kind of overdrive to expand wider and wider. Piles of cells, they would then start turning crystaline with fructose in the sunlight.</p><p>After the inevitable die off, in the muck of the fields swollen with manure and rotting vegetable, then rotting carcasus and rotting vegetables, and, then: a frightening silence of no birds or insects.</p><p>It seemed to be a return to an earlier form of time: the large monospecies dominance of Neoproterozoic was suggested as the most similar time period of countless acres of once fertile Midwest America, the bacteria, no longer beaten back by antibiotics and astringent, had the run of the world again, for a time. The fields turned into a teeming muck, giving off massive amounts of methane.</p><p>After the swelling and the die offs, the next year saw a new type of dandelion -- it's yellow top just off one shade of yellow. It expanded, but completely-- the ground seemed to be the perfect nutritional bath, some of the weeds grew to 3 meters high. It was resistant to herbacides. The fields that escaped the blight were quickly inundated, the survival crops decimated, also.</p><p>Some tried to turn it into a cash crop-- Demonlion Wine was one attempt, that was recalled when it's chemical makeup turned out to cause hypothyroidism in its heavy users. While the initial reports were quiet, discussed with hushed tones among academics, once the panic started it spread quickly -- quarantines at the borders of the states across the highways and trains then became quarantines in the cities and then the riots. Several archive from the "YouTube" illustrate the midwest famons the best. It was the "first personal civil war, a constantly twisting psychomachia of atrocity and counter atrocity", to quote Theodore-Riot the Vapor Punk Anthropologist, the street fights and car bombs spreading not in any "North or South" direction but seemingly in all directions and all at once. Military Academics describe the fighting as "the first case we know of of urban guerilla warfare using mostly drones". Machine learning running on server farms a thousand miles away to hunt and destroy fellow drones batttled in terrifying swarms above the cities, their corpses crashing into buildings, laying waste to the cities they, at alternating times, wished to protect or level.</p><p>Even the coastal cities saw unrest in the constantly shifting battle lines and theological wars. Radical Natureists used this as the opportunity to bomb refineries, declaring that the coasts would bring us into "a natures paradise" but only after the masses agreed to cull themselves 10 fold.</p><p>In this instance, capitalism actually had a solution to this unrest. A heavy investment into modern greenhouses to grow crops separated from the now toxic world made Icelandic business man Snorri Johansen and "Post-Ecological Terraforming Prophet" into a trillionaire. He quickly expanded into glass manufacturing-- massive solar powered high-focus sand cinterers across Tunesia and Algeria from its pristine, untouched state into a heavy industrial machine, turning sun and sand into quantum-diodes and diamond slabs for construction. Some remain concered about the long term ecological effects -- "In the next century it is possible that the entire Sahara Desert might be lowered up to 10 feet below sea level due to sand mining and manufacturing" reads one particularily shrill report. Will Neo-Carthage once again get claimed by nature and empire, its lands not even salted but negated by the final fits of industrial capitalism? History throws it's empty bottles out the window, says Chris Marker.</p><p>It was not until 4 years later did a full accounting of the cause of the decimation of the midwest be traced back to a single genetic engineer, working at lab at UCLA. The suspected perpetuater, like in the pre-crisis anthrax scare, committed suicide before he could be questioned.</p><h3>footnote (narrative):</h3><p>"I didn't realize that that summer before would be the last time any one of us heard the 17 year cicadas", recalls Doctor Marta Wexler, "as a girl we used to close the windows, turn on white noise machines to silence the screaming. It drove our dogs nuts. It was the loudest 17 year hatch he had ever heard, I remember one of my great uncles saying. The summer of silence stopped all that. The only sound I remember from that era is my mother crying, almost screaming, and the too light thud of her frail frame falling to the ground, the silence around us not even offering an echo in response. In the moment, I remember how I wanted, so badly to hear the cicadas again. To me it represent's natures last stand against us. A final howl of animal fecundity before the rational world with all of its genocides, mechanization and austerity claimed the Earth itself. I think I was seven."</p><p>references:</p><p>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2001_anthrax_attacks</p>

          <p><strong>VENICE BEACH, Calif. (AP)</strong> â Federal authorities have extended the quarantine zone around Venice Beach for an additional six months following what officials are calling "an ongoing biological containment situation."</p><p>The incident began three weeks ago when an art installation by the Los Angeles-based Meat Mind Collective experienced what the group initially described as "unplanned organic behavior." The installation consisted of approximately 40,000 liters of laboratory-grown muscle tissue housed in a transparent bio-plastic containment system on the Venice Beach boardwalk.</p><p>According to eyewitness accounts, the tissue began infiltrating the containment system's seals on the evening of Jan. 15. "It was wriggling itself into the bio-plastic casing," said Maria Gonzalez, 34, who operates a nearby taco stand. "Then it started leaking this oily stuff all over the boardwalk."</p><p>The discharge, which laboratory analysis later identified as approximately 50% industrial solvent and 50% necrotic cellular material, pooled on the boardwalk for several days while the Collective debated whether the behavior was intentional.</p><p>"We thought it might be part of the piece," said former Collective member James Chen, 28, speaking from an undisclosed location. "By the time we realized it wasn't, it was too late."</p><p>Three members of the Collective â identified as Rebecca Stein, 31, Marcus Williams, 29, and Yuki Tanaka, 42 â were reported missing on Jan. 22. Security footage shows them approaching the installation shortly before dawn. They have not been seen since.</p><p>The National Guard established a six-block perimeter on Jan. 28. Officials declined to comment on the current status of the biological material, citing "ongoing remediation efforts."</p><p>The Meat Mind Collective has disbanded. Its remaining members could not be reached for comment.</p><p>See also: <a href="#pink-slime-conciousness" class="wiki-link">Pink Slime Conciousness</a>, <a href="#pink-slime-aesthethic" class="wiki-link">Pink Slime Aesthethic</a>, <a href="#meat-mind-collective" class="wiki-link">Meat Mind Collective</a></p>

          <h1>The Dog</h1><p>Riding the 950 north to downtown, I see a dog loping through the liminal concrete space that is north of the interchange, full of containers of rubble. Her nipples swollen, she trots gingerly. She is perhaps a pitbull, though my memory clouds. Her nipples are swollen, her belly loose like a dog who just gave birth.</p><p>How did a dog get there, how did she survive?</p><p>Life finds liminal spaces, most of us shun it, but some will carve out a brutish living out of despiration or something visionary. Who can tell the difference between the two? I do not feel equipped.</p><p>I find myself thinking about her, about her puppies, and I think about the homeless men and women who live under the highway interchange, all the other denizens carving out a place in this concrete island, trapped there. I'm simply a tourist, I pass through it, I do not live it.</p>

          <p>Natan Dubovitsky</p><h1>Without Sky</h1><p>Translation copyright ÃÂ© 2014 by Bill Bowler</p><p>There was no sky over our village. ThatÃ¢â¬â¢s why we went to the city to watch the moon and birds, on the other side of the river. The people in the city were not thrilled to have us, but they did not try to stop us. On one of the hills, where the brick church stood, they even built an observation platform. Since for some reason they considered us drinkers, in addition to benches and a pay telescope, they built a small tavern by the observation deck, and a police post.</p><p>I could understand the city people. They had suffered greatly from the rage and envy of newcomers. And though it was insulting that they considered us - their closest neighbors, almost city people ourselves - intruders, still, we could understand them. And after all, they understood us. They didnÃ¢â¬â¢t drive us away. No matter what they wrote on their websites, they didnÃ¢â¬â¢t drive us away.</p><p>Everyone understood, if they were honest, that it was not our fault we were left with no sky. On the contrary, it was a great honor for us, in a way. The marshals of the four coalitions chose our sky for their decisive battle because the sky over our village was the best in the world: calm and cloudless. The sun flowed through our sky like a wide, peaceful river. I remember them well, the sun and the sky. The marshals found this place ideal for the final battle. ItÃ¢â¬â¢s not surprising. This was when all armies were airborne, and here there were no clouds, no turbulence. It was perfect.</p><p>This was the first non-linear war. In the primitive wars of the nineteenth, twentieth, and other middle centuries, the fight was usually between two sides: two nations or two temporary alliances. But now, four coalitions collided, and it wasnÃ¢â¬â¢t two against two, or three against one. It was all against all.</p><p>And what coalitions they were! Not like the earlier ones. It was a rare state that entered the coalition intact. What happened was some provinces took one side, some took the other, and some individual city, or generation, or sex, or professional society of the same state - took a third side. And then they could switch places, cross into any camp you like, sometimes during battle.</p><p>The goals of those in conflict were quite varied. Each had his own, so to speak: the seizing of disputed pieces of territory; the forced establishment of a new religion; higher ratings or rates; the testing of new military rays and airships; the final ban on separating people into male and female, since sexual differentiation undermines the unity of the nation; and so forth.</p><p>The simple-hearted commanders of the past strove for victory. Now they did not act so stupidly. That is, some, of course, still clung to the old habits and tried to exhume from the archives old slogans of the type: victory will be ours. It worked in some places, but basically, war was now understood as a process, more exactly, part of a process, its acute phase, but maybe not the most important.</p><p>Some peoples joined the war specifically to be defeated. They were inspired by the flowering of Germany and France after being routed in the second World War. It turned out that to achieve such a defeat was no simpler than achieving victory. Determination, sacrifice, and the extraordinary exertion of all forces were required, and, in addition, flexibility, cold-bloodedness, and the ability to profitably administer oneÃ¢â¬â¢s own cowardice and dullness.</p><p>But all of this was realized and analyzed later by historians and economists. Then, it was just war, World War V, and rather horrifying. I was six. We were all six or younger, all who today enter the Society, who are thirty years old now. We remember how, from the four corners of our sky, the four great armadas swooped down. These were not roaring, screeching and howling airborne apparatus of the old kind, as we had become used to seeing in the video-archives. For the first time, the newest, absolutely silent technology was employed, with some kind of invisible systems of complete noise reduction.</p><p>Hundreds of thousands of airplanes, helicopters, and rockets destroyed each other throughout a day in the silence of the tomb. Even falling, they were silent. Sometimes dying pilots screamed out, but rarely, because almost all of the machines were pilotless.</p><p>At that time, automatic machinery was being hurriedly brought into general use, and not only in the field of transportation. They introduced hotels without staff, stores without sales people, homes without masters, financial and industrial firms without directors. Even a couple of Ã¢â¬ÅpilotlessÃ¢â¬Â governments were organized as a result of democratic revolutions, so airplanes were nothing to speak of.</p><p>As a result, there was no one to scream while crashing onto roofs, bridges and monuments. The only sound was the cracking and crackling of our homes as they were destroyed beneath the rain of falling debris. And it wasnÃ¢â¬â¢t loud. The systems of sound reduction were effective across almost the complete depth of the battlefield.</p><p>Our parents tried to shelter us in the city. Above the city, the sky was clear, but the city people closed the city. Our parents cried for help from our side of the river. They begged them to at least take the children, at least those younger than ten, or seven, or three. Or younger than one year old. Or only the girls. And so forth. The city people did not open the city, and we children could understand them. We understood our parents, too, of course, including my own.</p><p>My father said: they wonÃ¢â¬â¢t let us in. We have to dig down. We burrowed into the riverbank sand, in a minuteÃ¢â¬â¢s time, it seemed. Everyone did, even the fattest and oldest of us. People donÃ¢â¬â¢t know themselves well. It might seem strange, but we are, in fact, much more nimble and intelligent than worms. One detail: it was winter. Freezing. The sand was hard.</p><p>Mama and Papa burrowed in together with me. They were warm and soft. Papa, a brave and clever man, brought some of my favorite candy from the house with him, a full pocket. And Mama bought my handheld game player. With it, I was happy and not bored in our burrow, so my time passed splendidly. The tail of an airplane fell on us, towards evening.</p><p>The fighter aircraft of the Northern Coalition were super-light, made of almost weightless materials. Even if an entire one of these fighters fell on us, the whole airplane, it would not have caused us serious harm. And Papa had dug us in pretty deep.</p><p>The place where we were hidden attracted the tail of another airplane. Unfortunately, it was an attack aircraft of the Southeastern League, an older plane, relatively silent, but heavy. Our burrow was deep, but not as deep as the tail of the attack fighter was heavy. The sand above us was frozen solid, but all the same, it was sand, not concrete, not steel, not the shawl of Our Lady: sand. And sand is not steel. I learned this well then, once and for all. And to this day, wake me up in the middle of the night and ask me: Is sand steel or not? I will answer: No! On the run, not pausing for a minute to think, not doubting. No.</p><p>I lay between Mama and Papa and didnÃ¢â¬â¢t hear the blow. ItÃ¢â¬â¢s possible that Papa made some funny quacking sound when the excessive weight crushed him, or he swore coarsely. One time he had yelled out something of the sort in front of me and frightened me.</p><p>ItÃ¢â¬â¢s possible that my mother also let out some kind of sound, but not necessarily. IÃ¢â¬â¢m not sure she even had time for a guilty smile, like the one she always had when something unpleasant happened to Papa or me. I hope it wasnÃ¢â¬â¢t painful.</p><p>They were killed. I wasnÃ¢â¬â¢t. Death wound round their bodies but didnÃ¢â¬â¢t reach mine. My brain was just touched by its black and stifling presence. Something boiled out of my brain and evaporated: the third dimension, height.</p><p>When they dug me out in the morning, chilled to the bone because my parents had quickly grown cold and become like the sand, I saw a two-dimensional world, endless in length and width, but without height. Without sky. Where is it, I asked? ItÃ¢â¬â¢s right there, they answered. I donÃ¢â¬â¢t see it, donÃ¢â¬â¢t see it! I became frightened.</p><p>They gave me treatment, but didnÃ¢â¬â¢t cure me. This kind of contusion, severe, canÃ¢â¬â¢t be cured. The tail of the attack fighter crushed my consciousness into a pancake. It became flat and simple. What do I see in place of the sky above our village? Nothing. What does it look like? What does it resemble? It looks like nothing, resembles nothing. ItÃ¢â¬â¢s not that this is incommunicable, inexpressible. ThereÃ¢â¬â¢s nothing of that. ThereÃ¢â¬â¢s just nothing.</p><p>After the war there were about fifty other cripples like me. All of us, the two-dimensionals, turned out to be the same age. Why? No one knew. The city scientists dug around in our consciousness for a while. They wrote a few treatises. They dragged us around to symposiums and talk-shows. Several foundations were organized on our behalf. Laughing at us was forbidden by a special law. They built an observation platform for us and a charitable institution. Then we went out of fashion and they forgot all about us.</p><p>If it was only that we didnÃ¢â¬â¢t see the sky above our village, that would be nothing, but our very thoughts lost the concept of height. We became two-dimensional. We understood only Ã¢â¬ÅyesÃ¢â¬Â and Ã¢â¬Åno,Ã¢â¬Â only Ã¢â¬ÅblackÃ¢â¬Â and Ã¢â¬Åwhite.Ã¢â¬Â There was no ambiguity, no half-tones, no saving graces. We did not know how to lie.</p><p>We understood everything literally, and that meant we were absolutely unsuited for life, helpless. We required constant care, but they abandoned us. They wouldnÃ¢â¬â¢t let us work. They wouldnÃ¢â¬â¢t pay us a disability pension. Many of us deteriorated, fell and perished. The rest of us organized ourselves to stay afloat, to save ourselves together or perish together.</p><p>We founded the Society and prepared a revolt of the simple, two-dimensionals against the complex and sly, against those who do not answer Ã¢â¬ÅyesÃ¢â¬Â or Ã¢â¬Åno,Ã¢â¬Â who do not say Ã¢â¬ÅwhiteÃ¢â¬Â or Ã¢â¬Åblack,Ã¢â¬Â who know some third word, many, many third words, empty, deceptive, confusing the way, obscuring the truth. In these shadows and spider webs, in these false complexities, hide and multiply all the villainies of the world. They are the House of Satan. ThatÃ¢â¬â¢s where they make bombs and money, saying: Ã¢â¬ÅHereÃ¢â¬â¢s money for the good of the honest; here are bombs for the defense of love.Ã¢â¬Â</p><p>We will come tomorrow. We will conquer or perish. There is no third way.</p><p>Translation copyright ÃÂ© 2014 by Bill Bowler</p>

          <p>I didn't like Tiepolo for many years. Too flouncy, all in pastel colors, the same perspective (from the ground, you stare up at beautiful angels and cherubs that could be allegory, but on further inspection say nothing).</p><p>I also liked that -- Giovanni being out of style these days until the Vapor Wave kids get ahold of him -- his room at the Prado was deliciously quiet. Everyone crowds the Bosch's and the Goyas, but it is quiet by the Tiepolos at the prado.</p><p>Tiepolo, being one of those artists who ran a studio closer to what we would call a factory, produced a lot. His looking up paintings sold well and so he did a lot of them. Los Angeles is quite blessed with several good Tiepolos, the best one is at the Norton Simon -- "The Victory of Virtue and Nobility over Ignorance"</p>

          <p>From the Miami New Times<br>retrieved on Sun 11 Mar 2018 02:39:37 PM PDT<br>http://www.miaminewtimes.com/news/five-bad-miami-affordable-housing-solutions-10159144</p><h1>Angels over Miami</h1><p>To homeless children sleeping on the street, neon is as comforting as a night-light. Angels love colored light too. After nightfall in downtown Miami, they nibble on the NationsBank building -- always drenched in a green, pink, or golden glow. "They eat light so they can fly," eight-year-old Andre tells the children sitting on the patio of the Salvation Army's emergency shelter on NW 38th Street. Andre explains that the angels hide in the building while they study battle maps. "There's a lot of killing going on in Miami," he says. "You want to fight, want to learn how to live, you got to learn the secret stories." The small group listens intently to these tales told by homeless children in shelters.</p><p>On Christmas night a year ago, God fled Heaven to escape an audacious demon attack -- a celestial Tet Offensive. The demons smashed to dust his palace of beautiful blue-moon marble. TV news kept it secret, but homeless children in shelters across the country report being awakened from troubled sleep and alerted by dead relatives. No one knows why God has never reappeared, leaving his stunned angels to defend his earthly estate against assaults from Hell. "Demons found doors to our world," adds eight-year-old Miguel, who sits before Andre with the other children at the Salvation Army shelter. The demons' gateways from Hell include abandoned refrigerators, mirrors, Ghost Town (the nickname shelter children have for a cemetery somewhere in Dade County), and Jeep Cherokees with "black windows." The demons are nourished by dark human emotions: jealousy, hate, fear.</p><p>See also: How a 1997 New Times Feature on Homeless Kids' Folklore Exploded the Internet</p><p>One demon is feared even by Satan. In Miami shelters, children know her by two names: <a href="#bloody-mary" class="wiki-link">Bloody Mary</a> and <a href="#la-llorona" class="wiki-link">La Llorona</a> (<a href="#the-crying-woman" class="wiki-link">the Crying Woman</a>). She weeps blood or black tears from ghoulish empty sockets and feeds on children's terror. When a child is killed accidentally in gang crossfire or is murdered, she croons with joy. "If you wake at night and see her," a ten-year-old says softly, "her clothes be blowing back, even in a room where there is no wind. And you know she's marked you for killing."</p><p>RELATED STORIES<br>Cocaine Smuggled in Dead Babies and Miami's Other Weirdest Urban Legends<br>The homeless children's chief ally is a beautiful angel they have nicknamed the <a href="#blue-lady" class="wiki-link">Blue Lady</a>. She has pale blue skin and lives in the ocean, but she is hobbled by a spell. "The demons made it so she only has power if you know her secret name," says Andre, whose mother has been through three rehabilitation programs for crack addiction. "If you and your friends on a corner on a street when a car comes shooting bullets and only one child yells out her true name, all will be safe. Even if bullets tearing your skin, the Blue Lady makes them fall on the ground. She can talk to us, even without her name. She says: 'Hold on.'"</p><p>A blond six-year-old with a bruise above his eye, swollen huge as a ruby egg and laced with black stitches, nods his head in affirmation. "I've seen her," he murmurs. A rustle of whispered Me toos ripples through the small circle of initiates.</p><p>According to the Dade Homeless Trust, approximately 1800 homeless children currently find themselves bounced between the county's various shelters and the streets. For these children, lasting bonds of friendship are impossible; nothing is permanent. A common rule among homeless parents is that everything a child owns must fit into a small plastic bag for fast packing. But during their brief stays in the shelters, children can meet and tell each other stories that get them through the harshest nights.</p><p>Folktales are usually an inheritance from family or homeland. But what if you are a child enduring a continual, grueling, dangerous journey? No adult can steel such a child against the outcast's fate: the endless slurs and snubs, the threats, the fear. What these determined children do is snatch dark and bright fragments of Halloween fables, TV news, and candy-colored Bible-story leaflets from street-corner preachers, and like birds building a nest from scraps, weave their own myths. The "secret stories" are carefully guarded knowledge, never shared with older siblings or parents for fear of being ridiculed -- or spanked for blasphemy. But their accounts of an exiled God who cannot or will not respond to human pleas as his angels wage war with Hell is, to shelter children, a plausible explanation for having no safe home, and one that engages them in an epic clash.</p><p>An astute folklorist can see traces of old legends in all new inventions. For example, Yemana, a Santeria ocean goddess, resembles the Blue Lady; she is compassionate and robed in blue, though she is portrayed with white or tan skin in her worshippers' shrines. And in the Eighties, folklorists noted references to an evil Bloody Mary -- or La Llorona, as children of Mexican migrant workers first named her -- among children of all races and economic classes. Celtic tales of revenants, visitors from the land of the dead sent to console or warn, arrived in America centuries ago. While those myths may have had some influence on shelter folklore, the tales homeless children create among themselves are novel and elaborately detailed. And they are a striking example of "polygenesis," the folklorist's term for the simultaneous appearance of vivid, similar tales in far-flung locales.</p><p>The same overarching themes link the myths of 30 homeless children in three Dade County facilities operated by the Salvation Army -- as well as those of 44 other children in Salvation Army emergency shelters in New Orleans, Chicago, and Oakland, California. These children, who ranged in age from six to twelve, were asked what stories, if any, they believed about Heaven and God -- but not what they learned in church. (They drew pictures for their stories with crayons and markers.) Even the parlance in Miami and elsewhere is the same. Children use the biblical term "spirit" for revenants, never "ghost" (says one local nine-year-old scornfully: "That baby word is for Casper in the cartoons, not a real thing like spirits!"). In their lexicon, they always use "demon" to denote wicked spirits.</p><p>casts them as comrades-in-arms, regardless of ethnicity (the secret stories are told and cherished by white, black, and Latin children), for the homeless youngsters see themselves as allies of the outgunned yet valiant angels in their battle against shared spiritual adversaries. For them the secret stories do more than explain the mystifying universe of the homeless; they impose meaning upon it.</p><p>Virginia Hamilton, winner of a National Book Award and three Newberys (the Pulitzer Prize of children's literature), is the only children's author to win a MacArthur Foundation genius grant. Her best-selling books, The People Could Fly and Herstories, trace African-American folklore through the diaspora of slavery. "Folktales are the only work of beauty a displaced people can keep," she explains. "And their power can transcend class and race lines because they address visceral questions: Why side with good when evil is clearly winning? If I am killed, how can I make my life resonate beyond the grave?"</p><p>That sense of mission, writes Harvard psychologist Robert Coles in The Spiritual Life of Children, may explain why some children in crisis -- and perhaps the adults they become -- are brave, decent, and imaginative, while others more privileged can be "callous, mean-spirited, and mediocre." The homeless child in Miami and elsewhere lives in a world where violence and death are commonplace, where it's highly advantageous to grovel before the powerful and shun the weak, and where adult rescuers are nowhere to be found. Yet what Coles calls the "ability to grasp onto ideals larger than oneself and exert influence for good" -- a sense of mission -- is nurtured in eerie, beautiful, shelter folktales.</p><p>In any group that generates its own legends -- whether in a corporate office or a remote Amazonian village -- the most articulate member becomes the semiofficial teller of the tales. The same thing happens in homeless shelters, even though the population is so transient. The most verbally skilled children -- such as Andre -- impart the secret stories to new arrivals. Ensuring that their truths survive regardless of their own fate is a duty felt deeply by these children, including one ten-year-old Miami girl who, after confiding and illustrating secret stories, created a self-portrait for a visitor. She chose a gray crayon to draw a gravestone carefully inscribed with her own name and the year 1998.</p><p>Here is what the secret stories say about the rules of spirit behavior: Spirits appear just as they looked when alive, even wearing favorite clothes, but they are surrounded by faint, colored light. When newly dead, the spirits' lips move but no sound is heard. They must learn to speak across the chasm between the living and the dead. For shelter children, spirits have a unique function: providing war dispatches from the fighting angels. And like demons, once spirits have seen your face, they can always find you.</p><p>Nine-year-old Phatt is living for a month in a Salvation Army shelter in northwest Dade. He and his mother became homeless after his father was arrested for drug-dealing and his mother couldn't pay the rent with her custodial job at a fast-food restaurant. (Phatt is his nickname. The first names of all other children in this article have been used with the consent of their parents or guardians.) "There's a river that runs through Miami. One side, called Bad Streets, the demons took over," Phatt recounts as he sits with four homeless friends in the shelter's playroom, which is decorated with pictures the children have drawn of homes, kittens, and hearts. "The other side the demons call Good Streets. Rich people live by a beach there. They wear diamonds and gold chains when they swim."</p><p>He explains that Satan harbors a special hatred of Miami owing to a humiliation he suffered while on an Ocean Drive reconnaissance mission. He was hunting for gateways for his demons and was scouting for nasty emotions to feed them. Satan's trip began with an exhilarating start; he moved undetected among high-rolling South Beach clubhoppers despite the fact that his skin was, as Phatt's friend Victoria explains, covered with scales like a "gold and silver snake."</p><p>Why didn't the rich people notice? Eight-year-old Victoria scrunches up her face, pondering. "Well, I think maybe sometimes they're real stupid so they get tricked," she replies. Plus, she adds, the Devil was "wearing all that Tommy Hilfiger and smoking Newports and drinking wine that cost maybe three dollars for a big glass." He found a large Hell door under the Colony Hotel, and just as he was offering the owner ten Mercedes-Benzes for use of the portal, he was captured by angels.</p><p>"The rich people said: 'Why are you taking our friend who buys us drinks?'" Phatt continues. "The angels tied him under the river and said: 'See what happens when the water touch him. Just see!'"</p><p>Phatt insists that his beloved cousin (and only father figure) Ronnie, who joined the U.S. Army to escape Liberty City and was killed last year in another city, warned him about what happened next at the river. (Ronnie was gunned down on Valentine's Day while bringing cupcakes to a party at the school where his girlfriend taught. He appeared to Phatt after that -- to congratulate him on winning a shelter spelling bee, and to show him a shortcut to his elementary school devoid of sidewalk drunks.)</p><p>One night this year Phatt and his mother made a bed out of plastic grocery bags in a Miami park where junkies congregate. It was his turn to stand guard against what he calls "screamers," packs of roaming addicts, while his mother slept. Suddenly Ronnie stood before him, dressed in his army uniform. "The Devil got loose from under the river!" Ronnie said. "The rich people didn't stop him! The angels need soldiers."</p><p>Phatt says his dead cousin told him that as soon as water touched the Devil's skin, it turned deep burgundy and horns grew from his head. The river itself turned to blood; ghostly screams and bones of children he had murdered floated from its depths. Just when the angels thought they had convinced Good Streets' denizens that they were in as much danger as those in Bad Streets, Satan vanished through a secret gateway beneath the river. "Now he's coming your way," Ronnie warned. "You'll need to learn how to fight." Ronnie nodded toward the dog-eared math and spelling workbooks Phatt carries even when he can't attend school. "Study hard," he implored. "Stay strong and smart so's you count on yourself, no one else. Never stop watching. Bloody Mary is coming with Satan. And she's seen your face."</p><p>Given what the secret stories of shelter children say about the afterlife, it isn't surprising that Ronnie appeared in his military uniform. There is no Heaven in the stories, though the children believe that dead loved ones might make it to an angels' encampment hidden in a beautiful jungle somewhere beyond Miami. To ensure that they find it, a fresh green palm leaf (to be used as an entrance ticket) must be dropped on the beloved's grave.</p><p>This bit of folklore became an obsession for eight-year-old Miguel. His father, a Nicaraguan immigrant, worked the overnight shift at a Miami gas station. Miguel always walked down the street by himself to bring his dad a soda right before the child's bedtime, and they'd chat. Then one night his father was murdered while on the job. Recalls Miguel: "The police say the robbers put lit matches all over him before they killed him."</p><p>Miguel's mother speaks no English and is illiterate. She was often paid less than two dollars per hour for the temporary jobs she could find in Little Havana (mopping shop floors, washing dishes in restaurants). After her husband's death, she lost her apartment. No matter where Miguel's family of three subsequently slept (a church pew, a shelter bed, a sidewalk), his father's spirit appeared, bloodied and burning all over with tiny flames. Miguel's teachers would catch him running out of his school in central Miami, his small fists filled with green palm leaves, determined to find his father's grave. A social worker finally took him to the cemetery, though Miguel refused to offer her any explanation. "I need my daddy to find the fighter angels," Miguel says from a Salvation Army facility located near Liberty City. "I'll go there when I'm killed."</p><p>The secret stories say the angel army hides in a child's version of an ethereal Everglades: A clear river of cold, drinkable water winds among emerald palms and grass as soft as a bed. Gigantic alligators guard the compound, promptly eating the uninvited. Says Phatt: "But they take care of a dead child's spirit while he learns to fight. I never seen it, but yes! I know it's out there" -- he sweeps his hand past the collapsing row of seedy motels lining the street on which the shelter is located -- "and when I do good, it makes their fighting easier. I know it! I know!"</p><p>All the Miami shelter children who participated in this story were passionate in defending this myth. It is the most necessary fiction of the hopelessly abandoned -- that somewhere a distant, honorable troop is risking everything to come to the rescue, and that somehow your bravery counts.</p><p>By the time homeless children reach the age of twelve, more or less, they realize that the secret stories are losing some of their power to inspire. They sadly admit there is less and less in which to believe. Twelve-year-old Leon, who often visits a Hialeah day-care center serving the homeless, has bruised-looking bags under his eyes seen normally on middle-aged faces. He has been homeless for six years. Even the shelters are not safe for him because his mother, who is mentally unstable, often insists on returning to the streets on a whim, her child in tow.</p><p>"I don't think any more that things happen for some great, good God plan, or for any reason," he says. "And I don't know if any angels are still fighting for us." He pauses and looks dreamily at the twilight sky above the day-care center. "I do think a person can dream the moment of his death. Sometimes I dream that when I die soon, I'll be in some high, great place where people have time to conversate. And even if there's no God or Heaven, it won't be too bad for me to be there."</p><p>Research by Harvard's Robert Coles indicates that children in crisis -- with a deathly ill parent or living in poverty -- often view God as a kind, empyrean doctor too swamped with emergencies to help. But homeless children are in straits so dire they see God as having simply disappeared. Christianity, Judaism, and Islam embrace the premise that good will triumph over evil in the end; in that respect, shelter tales are more bleakly sophisticated. "One thing I don't believe," says a seven-year-old who attends shelter chapels regularly, "is Judgment Day." Not one child could imagine a God with the strength to force evildoers to face some final reckoning. Yet even though they feel that wickedness may prevail, they want to be on the side of the angels.</p><p>When seven-year-old Maria is asked about the Blue Lady, she pauses. "When grownups talk about her, I think she get all upset," Maria slowly replies. She considers a gamble, then takes a chance and leans forward, beaming: "She's a magic lady, nice and pretty and smart! She live in the ocean and comes just to kids."</p><p>She first appeared to Maria at the deserted Freedom Tower in downtown Miami, which Maria calls "the pink haunted house." A fierce storm was pounding Miami that night. Other homeless people who had broken in milled about the building's interior, illuminated only by lightning. Her father was drunk. Her mother tried to stop him from eating the family's last food: a box of saltines. "He kept hitting her and the crazy people started laughing. When I try to help her, he hit me here" -- Maria points to her forehead. "I tried to sleep so my head and stomach would stop hurting, but they kept hurting." A blast of wind and rain shattered a window. "I was so scared. I pray out loud: Please, God, don't punish me no more!"</p><p>An older boy curled up nearby on a scrap of towel tried to soothe her. "Hurricanes ain't God," he said gently. "It's Blue Lady bringing rain for the flowers." When Maria awoke late in the night, she saw the angel with pale blue skin, blue eyes, and dark hair standing by the broken window. Her arms dripped with pink, gold, and white flowers. "She smiled," Maria says, her dark eyes wide with amazement. "My head was hurting, but she touched it and her hand was cool like ice. She say she's my friend always. That's why she learned me the hard song." The song is complex and strange for such a young child; its theme is the mystery of destiny and will. When Maria heard a church choir sing it, she loved it, but the words were too complicated. "Then the Blue Lady sang it to me," she recalls. "She said it'll help me grow up good, not like daddy."</p><p>Maria's voice begins shakily, then becomes more assured: "If you believe within your heart you'll know/that no one can change the path that you must go./ Believe what you feel and you'll know you're right because/when love finally comes around, you can say it's yours./ Believe you can change what you see!/ Believe you can act, not just feel!/You have a brain!/You have a heart!/You have the courage to last your life!/Please believe in yourself as I believe in you!"</p><p>As she soars to a finish, Maria suddenly realizes how much that she's revealed to a stranger: "I told the secret story and the Blue Lady isn't mad!" She's awash with relief. "Even if my mom say we sleep in the bus station when we leave the shelter, Blue Lady will find us. She's seen my face."</p><p>Shelter children often depict the Blue Lady in their drawings as blasting demons and gangbangers with a pistol. But the secret stories say that she cannot take action unless her real name -- which no one knows -- is called out. The children accept that. What they count on her for is love, though they fear that abstract love won't be enough to withstand an evil they believe is relentless and real. The evil is like a dark ocean waiting to engulf them, as illustrated by a secret story related by three different girls in separate Miami homeless facilities. It is a story told only by and to homeless girls, and it explains how the dreaded Bloody Mary can invade souls.</p><p>Ten-year-old Otius, dressed in a pink flowered dress, leads a visitor by the hand away from four small boys who are sitting in a shelter dining room snacking on pizza and fruit juice. "Every girl in the shelters knows if you tell this story to a boy, your best friend will die!" she says with a shiver. When the boys try to sneak up behind her, she refuses to speak until they return to their places.</p><p>She begins: "Some girls with no home feel claws scratching under the skin on their arms. Their hand looks like red fire. It's Bloody Mary dragging them in for slaves -- to be in gangs, be crackheads. But every 1000 girls with no home, is a Special One. When Bloody Mary comes, the girl is so smart and brave, a strange thing happens." Bloody Mary disappears, she says, then a pretty, luminous face glows for a moment in the dark. The girl has glimpsed what Bloody Mary looked like before she became wicked. "The Special One," Otius continues, "is somebody Bloody Mary is scared of because she be so good, people watch her for what to do. And if she dies, she will die good.</p><p>"Boys always brag what they can do, but this is the job of girls and -- I wish maybe I were a Special One," Otius says wistfully. "Maybe one of my friends from the shelters are now. I'll never see them again -- so's I guess I never know."</p><p>Her name was first spoken in hushed tones among children all over America nearly twenty years ago. Even in Sweden folklorists reported Bloody Mary's fame. Children of all races and classes told of the hideous demon conjured by chanting her name before a mirror in a pitch-dark room. (In Miami shelters, the mirror must be coated with ocean water, a theft from the Blue Lady's domain.) And when she crashes through the glass, she mutilates children before killing them. Bloody Mary is depicted in Miami kids' drawings with a red rosary that, the secret stories say, she uses as a weapon, striking children across the face.</p><p>Folklorists were so mystified by the Bloody Mary polygenesis, and the common element of using a mirror to conjure her, that they consulted medical literature for clues. Bill Ellis, a folklorist and professor of American studies at Penn State University, puzzled over a 1968 Journal of Nervous and Mental Disease article describing an experiment testing the theory that schizophrenics are prone to see hallucinations in reflected surfaces. The research showed that the control group of nonpsychotic people reported seeing vague, horrible faces in a mirror after staring at it for twenty minutes in a dim room. But that optical trick the brain plays was merely a partial explanation for the children's legend.</p><p>"Whenever you ask children where they first heard one of their myths, you get answers that are impossible clues: 'A friend's friend read it in a paper; a third cousin told me,'" says Ellis, an authority on children's folklore, particularly that concerning the supernatural. As president of the International Society for Contemporary Legend Research, he's become an expert on polygenesis. "When a child says he got the story from the spirit world, as homeless children do, you've hit the ultimate non sequitur."</p><p>Folklorists have not discovered a detailed explanation for Bloody Mary's ravenous hatred of children, or her true identity. Today, however, shelter children say they've discovered her secret mission, as well as her true name. All of the secret stories about her enclose hints.</p><p>In Chicago shelters, children tell of her role in the death of eleven-year-old Robert Sandifer, who shot an innocent fourteen-year-old schoolgirl he mistook for an enemy. Cops combed the streets, shaking down gangbangers. In desperation Sandifer's gang turned to the one who could save them from justice. They sat in a dark room before a mirror and chanted, "Bloody Mary." The wall glowed like flames. A female demon weeping black tears appeared. Without speaking, she communicated a strategy.</p><p>IF YOU LIKE THIS STORY, CONSIDER SIGNING UP FOR OUR EMAIL NEWSLETTERS.<br>SHOW ME HOW<br>That night, realizing his gang was going to kill him, Sandifer ran through his neighborhood, knocking on doors. "Like baby Jesus in Bethlehem -- except he was bad," explained an eleven-year-old at a Chicago homeless shelter. The next morning police found Sandifer's body, shot through the head, in a tunnel. According to the eleven-year-old, the boy was "lying on a bed of broken glass."</p><p>Bloody Mary commands legions. She can insinuate herself into the heart of whomever children trust most: a parent or a best friend. Miami shelter children say they learned about that from television. Salvation Army shelters offer parlors with couches, magazines, and a television. While their mothers play cards and do each other's hair, the children carefully study the TV news. They know how four-year-old Kendia Lockhart died in North Dade, allegedly beaten to death and burned by her father. Bloody Mary was hunting Kendia, shelter children agree. "Gangsters say that God stories are like Chinese fairy tales," observes twelve-year-old Deion at a downtown Miami Salvation Army shelter. "But even gangs think Bloody Mary is real."</p><p>This is the secret story shelter children will tell only in hushed voices, for it reveals Bloody Mary's mystery: God's final days before his disappearance were a waking dream. There were so many crises on Earth that he never slept. Angels reported rumors of Bloody Mary's pact with Satan: She had killed her own child and had made a secret vow to kill all human children. All night God listened as frantic prayers bombarded him. Images of earthly lives flowed across his palace wall like shadows while he heard gunfire, music, laughing, crying from all over Earth. And then one night Bloody Mary roared over the walls of Heaven with an army from Hell. God didn't just flee from the demons, he went crazy with grief over who led them. Bloody Mary, some homeless children say the spirits have told them, was Jesus Christ's mother.</p><p>"No one believe us! But it's true! It's true!" cries Andre at the Salvation Army shelter on NW 38th Street. "It mean there's no one left in the sky watching us but demons." His friends sitting on the shelter patio chime in with Bloody Mary sightings: She flew shrieking over Charles Drew Elementary School. She stalks through Little Haiti, invisible to police cars. "I know a boy who learned to sleep with his eyes open, but she burned through a shelter wall to get him!" a seven-year-old boy says. "When the people found him, he was all red with blood. Don't matter if you're good, don't matter if you're smart. You got to be careful! If she see you, she can hunt you forever. She's in Miami! And she knows our face.</p>
